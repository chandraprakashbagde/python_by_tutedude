## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

### Problem Statement
Write a Python program that does the following:
1. Opens and reads a text file named sample.txt.
2. Prints its content line by line.
3. Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

---

### Example Output

**Output:**
If the file exists:

Reading file content:
Line 1: This is a sample text file.
Line 2: It contains multiple lines.

If the file does not exist:

Error: The file 'sample.txt' was not found.

### How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the code file.
2. Open a terminal in the project folder.
3. Navigate to "python_by_tutedude/ASSIGNMENT-4/"
3. Run the program with:
   ```bash
   python Task-1.py


## Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File

### Problem Statement
Write a Python program that does the following:
1. Takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt.
2. Appends additional data to the same file.
3. Reads and displays the final content of the file.

### Example Input / Output

**Output:**
Enter text to write to the file: Hello, Python!
Data successfully written to output.txt.

Enter additional text to append: Learning file handling in Python.
Data successfully appended.

Final content of output.txt:
Hello, Python!
Learning file handling in Python.

### How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the code file.
2. Open a terminal in the project folder.
3. Navigate to "python_by_tutedude/ASSIGNMENT-4/"
3. Run the program with:
   ```bash
   python Task-2.py
